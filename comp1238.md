## Week 1 Notes: Historical Introduction to Text and Writing

- First writing examples was found in Iraq around 5000 years ago
- The first writing form was "Cuneiform" -> Created by pressing a stylus into a clay
- Early wirting was started as pictures and slowly turned into symbols for sounds ->  Modern Japanese Hiragana, alsorepresents sounds instead of full words
- One of the oldest stories ever writtern ( 2000 BCE ) -> is about friendship, pride, life and search for immortality

<summary>other writing systems  </summary>

- **Chinese characters** (still used today)
- **Mesoamerican writing** (like the Maya glyphs)
- **Indian Brahmi script** (may have been influenced by other writing systems)
- **Later writing systems:** Korean Hangul, Inuktitut syllabics

## Week 2 Notes: Text and Numbers in Computers

- **Bit:** Short for binary digit, representing one of two states (0 or 1).
- **Byte:** A group of 8 bits.
- **Binary Numbers:** Numbers represented using base 2.
- Volatile Memory: Loses data when power is off (e.g., RAM). -> RAM: Fast, volatile memory for active processes.
- Non-Volatile Memory: Retains data without power (e.g., SSD, HDD). -> Storage Device: Include SSDs and HDDs, used for long-term data storage.
- Unsigned Numbers: Range from 0 to 255 for 8 bits.
- Signed Numbers: Range from -128 to 127 for 8 bits.
- Fractional Numbers: Represented using scientific notation with two integers.

## Week 3 Notes: Structure of Text

### Markdown:

- Simple syntax for formatting.
- Titles: # Title, ## Subtitle
- Italic: _italic_
- Bold: **bold**
- Lists: * item or - item
- Rendering: Conversion from raw text to formatted view.

### HTML:

- More verbose than Markdown.
- Tags: `<ul>, <li>, <p>, <strong>, <h1>, <h2>, <h3>`



**Special Characters**:  
  - Non-alphanumeric symbols like `@`, `#`, `$`, `&`, `*`.  
  - Escape sequences prevent special interpretation.  
  - Example: `\#` to display `#` in Markdown.  
    
**HTML Escaping**:  
  - Use `&lt;` for `<`, `&gt;` for `>`, `&amp;` for `&`.


## Unicode
- Similar to ASCII - assigns numbers to characters, but allows for much larger numbers and therefore more characters.
- While in ASCII the numbers are called "ASCII **codes**", in unicode the name used is "Unicode **codepoints**"
- In contrast to ASCII there are multiple different ways of converting the codepoints into a binary representation:
  - UTF-32 simply uses 4 bytes to store the codepoint number of in binary, but this wastes a lot of space because most bytes end up being filled with zeroes.
  - UTF-8 is identical to ASCII for all the basic characters but uses multiple bytes for codepoints above 127. UTF-8 is by far the most popular encoding on the internet.
- Unicode codepoints are usually written as hex number with prefix `U+` for example `U+21AA` is the codepoint for this character: â†ª  
Note that the binary representation for this codepoint will be different depending on which encoding is used, but in most cases we use UTF-8.

## Week 4 Notes: Manipulating Text & Text Editors

### Keyboard Mastery  
- **Importance**: Efficient typing reduces cognitive load.  
- **Types**:  
  - Standard 104-key layout.  
  - Variants like split, vertical, and ortholinear keyboards.  
- **Layouts**:  
  - QWERTY, AZERTY, Dvorak.  
- **Modifier Keys**: modify the behavior of other keys - Control, Shift, Alt etc.
- **Touch Typing**: Encouraged for efficiency and reduced fatigue.

### Text Editors  
- **Types**:  
  - Word Processors (e.g., Microsoft Word) vs. Text Editors (e.g., Notepad).  
- **Popular Editors**:  
  - **Vim**: Command-line based, requires learning commands.  
    - Exit command: `:q!`  
  - **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**: Widely used, feature-rich.  
    - Extensions and themes available.  
- **IDEs**: Integrated Development Environments like WebStorm, Pycharm.
- **Basic Search**: Use `Ctrl + F` for finding text.
- **Wildcards**: Use `*` for any character sequence.  
- **Regex (Regular Expressions)**: For pattern matching.  
    - Example: `line\d+` finds "line" followed by digits.

## Week 5 Notes:Command Line Interfaces
### Modern CLI Usage  
- **Advantages**:  
  - Some functionalities are only available via CLI.  
  - Faster for certain tasks compared to graphical interfaces.  
  - Easier automation through scripting.  
  - Efficient for remote work with low bandwidth requirements.  
  - Minimal resource usage on computers.  
   
### Basic CLI Commands  
- **Navigation and File Management**:  
  - `ls`: List files in a directory.  
  - `cd`: Change directory.  
  - `pwd`: Print working directory.  
  - `cat`: Display file contents.  
  - `less`: View file contents interactively.  
  - `cp`: Copy files.  
  - `mv`: Move files.  
  - `mkdir`: Create a directory.  
  - `ping`: Test network connectivity.  
   
- **Advanced Commands**:  
  - `grep`: Search text using patterns.  
  - Redirection and piping: Direct output to files or other commands.
  - **SSH (Secure Shell)**:  
  - Connect to remote computers securely.  
  - Allows command line access to remote system

## Week 6 Notes: Git, GitHub, Diff, and Versioning

## Git and GitHub  
- **Git:**  
  - Open-source tool for version control.  
  - Installed locally to manage files on your disk.  
  - Developed by Linus Torvalds in 2005.  
- **GitHub:**  
  - Cloud service for hosting Git repositories.  
  - Provides additional features like web-based editing.  
  - Owned by Microsoft.  

     
## Basic Git Workflow  
1. **Clone:** Copy a remote repository to your local machine.  
2. **Pull:** Retrieve the latest changes from the remote repository.  
3. **Modify:** Edit files locally.  
4. **Commit:** Save changes to your local repository.  
   - `git commit -m "commit message"`  
5. **Push:** Upload changes to the remote repository.  
   
## Diff and Patch  
- **Diff Tool:** Compares two files to highlight differences.  
  - Example command: `diff file1.txt file2.txt`  
- **Patch Files:** Describe changes to apply to files.  

## Tools and Commands  
- **Command Line Client:** Uniform across different systems.  
- **VS Code Integration:** Recommended for beginners.  
- **Git Commands:**  
  - `git clone <repo-url>`: Clone a repository.  
  - `git pull`: Update local repo with remote changes.  
  - `git push`: Upload local changes to remote repo.  
  - `git commit -m "message"`: Commit changes with a message.
