## Week 1 Notes: Historical Introduction to Text and Writing

- First writing examples was found in Iraq around 5000 years ago
- The first writing form was "Cuneiform" -> Created by pressing a stylus into a clay
- Early wirting was started as pictures and slowly turned into symbols for sounds ->  Modern Japanese Hiragana, alsorepresents sounds instead of full words
- One of the oldest stories ever writtern ( 2000 BCE ) -> is about friendship, pride, life and search for immortality

- **Chinese characters** (still used today)
- **Mesoamerican writing** (like the Maya glyphs)
- **Indian Brahmi script** (may have been influenced by other writing systems)
- **Later writing systems:** Korean Hangul, Inuktitut syllabics

## Week 2 Notes: Text and Numbers in Computers

- **Bit:** Short for binary digit, representing one of two states (0 or 1).
- **Byte:** A group of 8 bits.
- **Binary Numbers:** Numbers represented using base 2.
- Volatile Memory: Loses data when power is off (e.g., RAM). -> RAM: Fast, volatile memory for active processes.
- Non-Volatile Memory: Retains data without power (e.g., SSD, HDD). -> Storage Device: Include SSDs and HDDs, used for long-term data storage.
- Unsigned Numbers: Range from 0 to 255 for 8 bits.
- Signed Numbers: Range from -128 to 127 for 8 bits.
- Fractional Numbers: Represented using scientific notation with two integers.

## Week 3 Notes: Structure of Text

### Markdown:

- Simple syntax for formatting.
- Titles: # Title, ## Subtitle
- Italic: _italic_
- Bold: **bold**
- Lists: * item or - item
- Rendering: Conversion from raw text to formatted view.

### HTML:

- More verbose than Markdown.
- Tags: `<ul>, <li>, <p>, <strong>, <h1>, <h2>, <h3>`



**Special Characters**:  
  - Non-alphanumeric symbols like `@`, `#`, `$`, `&`, `*`.  
  - Escape sequences prevent special interpretation.  
  - Example: `\#` to display `#` in Markdown.  
    
**HTML Escaping**:  
  - Use `&lt;` for `<`, `&gt;` for `>`, `&amp;` for `&`.


## Unicode
- Similar to ASCII - assigns numbers to characters, but allows for much larger numbers and therefore more characters.
- While in ASCII the numbers are called "ASCII **codes**", in unicode the name used is "Unicode **codepoints**"
- In contrast to ASCII there are multiple different ways of converting the codepoints into a binary representation:
  - UTF-32 simply uses 4 bytes to store the codepoint number of in binary, but this wastes a lot of space because most bytes end up being filled with zeroes.
  - UTF-8 is identical to ASCII for all the basic characters but uses multiple bytes for codepoints above 127. UTF-8 is by far the most popular encoding on the internet.
- Unicode codepoints are usually written as hex number with prefix `U+` for example `U+21AA` is the codepoint for this character: â†ª  
Note that the binary representation for this codepoint will be different depending on which encoding is used, but in most cases we use UTF-8.
